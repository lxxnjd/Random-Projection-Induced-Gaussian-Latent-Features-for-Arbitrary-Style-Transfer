### Key Features of this README:
1. **GitHub-friendly format**: Uses standard Markdown syntax, code blocks for commands, and emoji icons for readability (optional to remove if you prefer a more minimalist style).
2. **Accurate terminology**: Maintains consistent academic terms (EFDM+RP/AdaIN+RP) and technical expressions.
3. **Clear structure**: Separates core sections (Updated Content/Usage/Future Plans) for easy navigation.
4. **Practical notes**: Includes environment/parameter/model file tips to help users avoid common issues.

### Optional Minimalist Version:
```markdown
# Random-Projection-Induced-Gaussian-Latent-Features-for-Arbitrary-Style-Transfer
This repository hosts the official code implementation for the paper "Random Projection-Induced Gaussian Latent Features for Arbitrary Style Transfer".

## Updated Content
The following module implementations are currently available:
- EFDM+RP (Exact Feature Distribution Matching + Random Projection)
- AdaIN+RP (Adaptive Instance Normalization + Random Projection)

Code for additional modules will be released incrementally.

## Usage
### Quick Execution
Run the style transfer task with the command below. Specify input and output parameters as required before execution:
```bash
python test.py
